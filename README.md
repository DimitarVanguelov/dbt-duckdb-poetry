# dbt + duckdb + poetry

This repo is simply a slightly different take on the
[jaffle_shop_duckdb](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb) repo.

Whereas the original relies on manual versioning environments with `venv` and `pip` and
`requirements.txt` files, this version relies solely on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
for package and environment management.
